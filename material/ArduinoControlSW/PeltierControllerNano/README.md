# What is inside here?

This folder contains the source code of the control software running on the Arduino Nano. It is placed inside a folder with the same name, since only in that way it can be opened with the Arduino IDE.

**This is the version with a two point control mechanism with the usage of the thermistor. In this version the temperature needs to be defined in the source file.**
