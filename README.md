# haptics-showroom
This is repository contains the source code and documentation of the final project of the Computational Haptics lab conducted at the TUM summer semester 2017.

## General Idea

The general idea is to create a virtual room (like a show room), where you can walk around by pressing some keys (like in an ego shooter). Optionally also the Oculus Rift could be used to make the experience even more realistic. With one or two haptic devices as tools (or "hands") it is possible to interact with different objects placed inside the room. In this way people who are not familiar with Computational Haptics get to know many different possibilities what can be done in with haptic devices.
